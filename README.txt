# The Italian Club — PWA

A mobile-first Progressive Web App for a bakery/restaurant, with two sections:

- **Calculator** — dough scaling from production orders (Focaccia, Brioche, Sourdough).
- **Orders** — weekly supplier-order workflow: suppliers & ingredients, stock-based
  order suggestions learned from history, autosaving real-time draft, preview and
  WhatsApp/Email send, order history, and a management panel.

## Firebase config
`js/firebase.js` is **committed to Git**: Firebase web API keys are public config
(sent to every visitor's browser), not secrets. Security comes from Firestore
Security Rules + API key restrictions, never from hiding the file.
`js/firebase.example.js` is the matching template (placeholder values + docs for
the Orders collections and the future FCM setup). Keep it in sync with firebase.js.

Real secrets (service-account JSON, `.env`) are never committed.

## Local testing
Service workers and Firebase need a server (not file://):
```
npx http-server . -p 8765
```
then open http://localhost:8765/

## Deploy
Hosted on GitHub Pages — every push to `main` goes live automatically.
After editing any cached file, bump `CACHE_NAME = 'theitalianclub-vNN'` in sw.js
so users receive the update. Deploy Firestore rules separately when they change:
```
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Versioning
Releases are tracked with git tags (semver `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), never by renaming
the repo. First release: v1.0.0.

## Install on a device
Open the install guide and follow the steps for your device:
https://federicomiano93.github.io/the_italian_club_app/install-guide.html
- iPhone/iPad: Safari → Share → "Add to Home Screen".
- Android: Chrome → "Install app" / menu → "Add to Home screen".
- Computer: Chrome/Edge → install icon in the address bar.
(Installs once per device; after that it opens like any app. Browsers do not allow
automatic install — a one-time user action is always required.)

## Works offline
The service worker precaches the app and serves a cached copy instantly, updating
in the background. Cross-origin requests (Firebase, Google Fonts, gov.uk) are never
cached.

## Data model (Firestore)
Calculator:
- `log/{dough}` — current-session log per dough type.
- `daily-logs/{YYYY-MM-DD}` — daily production log, keyed by dough type.

Orders (every document carries `bakery: "main"`):
- `suppliers/{id}` — name, category, deliveryDays, orderDays, phone, email, active.
- `ingredients/{id}` — name, supplierId, category, unit, active.
- `drafts/current` — the order in progress (autosaved, real-time), plus the day each
  supplier's rows were typed on.
- `orders-history/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{supplierId}` — one record per DAY per SUPPLIER
  (ordered quantities + stock on hand). Records from the earlier weekly model
  (`orders-history/{weekId}`) are still read; nothing was migrated.

All collections are currently shared across authenticated clients (Anonymous Auth).

## Security
- **Firestore rules** (firestore.rules) enforced server-side: auth required, payloads
  validated, deletes restricted, default-deny for unmatched collections.
- **Anonymous Auth** on startup — no login screen; a silent token is required to
  read/write.
- **Content Security Policy** on every page restricts what the browser may load
  (scripts/connections/styles/fonts allow-listed).
- **XSS-safe rendering** — Firestore data is rendered via textContent/createElement,
  never innerHTML.

## Notifications
Order alerts (order due, bank holiday next week, delivery-day conflict) are
client-side: in-app banners + browser notifications while the app is open. Push to
staff with the app closed needs a server step (Firebase Cloud Functions) — deferred;
see the FCM notes in js/firebase.example.js.
