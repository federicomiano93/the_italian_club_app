// help-content.js — PURE: what each screen of the app is for, in a few lines.
//
// It is only text and it is deliberately here, in one file, rather than written into
// each screen: an explanation that lives next to the thing it explains gets edited
// when the code does, and an explanation kept in one place gets READ as a set, which
// is how you notice that two of them contradict each other.
//
// ⚠️ SHORT ON PURPOSE. Three to five lines, and the last one is the trap — the thing
// somebody would otherwise learn by getting it wrong. A screen-by-screen manual is a
// thing people do not read and nobody keeps up to date, and an explanation that has
// drifted out of date is worse than none: it is believed.
//
// The wording is English like every other word in the app, so the two people in the
// bakery who do not read Italian get the same help as everyone else.

// Each entry: the screen's own name, and the lines. Kept as an ARRAY rather than one
// blob so the tests can hold each line to its own length, and so a line can never be
// lost inside a paragraph.
