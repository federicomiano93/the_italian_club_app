// old weekly model: the legacy weekly documents (one per ISO week, all suppliers
// merged) stay readable by both the history view and the suggestion engine, so

// map the suggestion engine averages over. A "stock was full so I ordered 0" row
// has a HIGH level (stock + 0) and there is no matching downward pull, so
