// management.js — the Orders SETTINGS panel (the gear in the bottom bar).
//
// How the order screen looks, when the working week starts, which roads an order
// may leave by, and the alerts. That is all it is now, and the word above the
// screen finally matches what is behind it.
//
// ⚠️ THE SUPPLIER AND INGREDIENT RECORDS LEFT THIS FILE. They were here — two lists
// of business data sitting under a gear, four levels down — and they are neither
// settings nor rare: the ingredient form is where the whole allergen job happens.
// They live on their own screen now (js/orders/registry.js, suppliers.html), one
// tap from the Home. The helpers both halves still share are in js/orders/mgmt-ui.js.
//
// ⚠️ THE PANEL IS OPEN TO EVERYBODY IN THE LOCATION, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN, not
// a leftover. isAdmin below is the old placeholder from before roles existed; it
// still reads `true` because the panel really is for everybody. What is gated is
// each individual control — two of the four sections are drawn only for whoever
// runs the place, and firestore.rules refuses the write regardless of what this
// page decides to show (P2).
//
// data: { ordersConfig(): {} } — a live getter from orders-main.
