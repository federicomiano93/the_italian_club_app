// ⚠️⚠️ A MANIFEST IS READ WHEN THE APP IS INSTALLED, NOT WHEN IT UPDATES — and that cost
// an evening on 21 Aug 2026.
//
// The manifest lost `"orientation": "portrait"` so a tablet could be used on its stand.
// It shipped, the tablet took the new CODE, and stayed locked upright anyway: Android
// had applied the orientation when the app was added to the home screen, and no update
// can reach that. Federico turned his tablet, found it sideways, and only a photograph
// of ANDROID'S OWN STATUS BAR rotated with the app identified the cause.
//
// The app cannot fix this by itself. What it can do is NOTICE and say so, which is what
// js/install-version.js is for. These checks pin the two halves that matter:
//   · the fingerprint covers exactly the fields a re-install is needed for, and is
//     stable against harmless rewrites of the file
//   · the notice NEVER fires when it has nothing to compare against
//
// ⚠️ And the last test bans the repeat: manifest.json may not change without the change
// being declared, because every change to it costs a re-install on every device.
