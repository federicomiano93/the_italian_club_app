// tests/english-text.test.mjs states about itself. Seven strings were hard-coded on the
// day this was written; correcting only those leaves the eighth to be written wrong, and
// a literal is invisible in review because it looks exactly like every other string.
//
// WHAT IT COST BEFORE IT EXISTED. Four i18n suites already guard this app — the HTML's
// `data-i18n`, the keys existing, the label/interface separation, the English grammar —
// and **not one of them looks at a literal passed to `text:`**. So on an Italian phone:
//
//   Order · Stock   the labels on EVERY row of EVERY order, the two words read most
//   Management      the title of the Settings screen itself
//   Alerts · Price  two headings inside it
//
// None of that is a style slip. It is the screen somebody works on all day, in the wrong
// language, on the app's own account.

// Turning the scan on found 22 more strings beyond the seven it was written for, across
// FIVE features — the Catalogue, Staff, Food Cost, Pastries and the Log. Every one is a
// screen that stays English on an Italian phone.
//
// They are NOT fixed here, and the reason is not laziness:
//   * each needs an Italian translation somebody should actually read, and 22 written in
//     one sitting by the person who also wrote the code is how a half-translated app
//     happens;
//   * at least one is constrained — js/log-model.js is a PURE model, and this project
//     already has a test forbidding label models from importing the interface language,
//     so "wrap it in t()" may be the wrong answer there and needs its own thought.
//
// ⚠️ THE LIST MAY ONLY EVER SHRINK. A new literal is not on it, so it fails. That is the
// whole job: this test exists to stop the twenty-third, not to pretend the twenty-two
// are not there. Delete a line as you fix it; never add one.
// ⚠️ WIDENING THE SCAN ADDS TO THIS LIST ONCE, AND ONLY THE SCAN MAY DO SO. That is
// exactly what happened when it was first switched on (the note above), and again on
// 22 Aug 2026 when `field(` and `message:` were added: four features turned out to be
// asking a confirmation question in English. The four Orders and five records strings
// the same widening found were FIXED rather than listed, because they are in the files
// that PR owned — a debt entry for a file you are already editing is just a dodge.
